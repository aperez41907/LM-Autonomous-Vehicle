# LM-Autonomous-Vehicle

Project Overview: UCF students from ECE, ME, AND CS departments will coordinate to design, build & test, and demonstrate a manually remote-controlled ground robot with automated target detection, aiming, and firing capabilities by using multiple sensing technologies.

The ECE group is required to present software that only detects color and motion and is not allowed to present the more advanced facial & object recognition software developed by the CS group.

This repository contains the Basic Targeting software that the ECE students will integrate into their custom mobile targeting system.
