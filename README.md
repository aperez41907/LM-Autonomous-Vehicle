# LM-Autonomous-Vehicle

Project Overview: UCF students from ECE, ME, AND CS departments will coordinate to design, build & test, and demonstrate a manually remote-controlled ground robot with automated target detection, aiming, and firing capabilities by using multiple sensing technologies.

The primary requirement for the ECE group is to manufacture a custom printed circuit board with surface mounted parts.The ECE group is only required to present a targeting system that detects color or motion and is not allowed to present the more advanced facial & object recognition software developed by the CS group.

This repository contains the Basic Targeting Software (under development as of January 2017) that the ECE students will integrate into the custom mobile targeting system and present at the Spring 2017 Electrical & Computer Engineering Senior Design Showcase.
