INSTRUCTIONS:

(These instructions assume you have already installed the 32-bit Processing 1.5.1 IDE and Arduino IDE to your 'My Documents' folder.



1) Copy the 'Arduino' and 'Processing' folders to your 'My Documents' folder (or to whichever
	folder 'arduino-1.0.3' and 'processing-1.5.1' are located in). If you already have folders
	called 'Arduino' or 'Processing', then merge these with them.



2) Copy dll files to windows/system, windows/system32, windows/sysWOW64

3) Open "Group02_BasicTargetingSoftware_ArduinoCode.ino" in the Arduino IDE, select the proper type in
	the "#define type" line, and upload it to your Arduino or Standalone controller.
	You only need to do this once ever, so close the Arduino IDE.



4) Finally, open "Group02_BasicTargetingSoftware.pde" in the Processing IDE. Click run, and the code should start up for you.
