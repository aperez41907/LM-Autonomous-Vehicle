INSTRUCTIONS:

(These instructions assume you have already installed the 32-bit Processing 1.5.1 IDE 
	and Arduino IDE to your 'My Documents' folder.)

Please note this program only works on Windows OS!

1) Copy the 'Arduino' and 'Processing' folders to your 'My Documents' folder (or to whichever
	folder 'arduino-1.0.3' and 'processing-1.5.1' are located in). If you already have folders
	called 'Arduino' or 'Processing', then merge these with them.
	
	The general layout:
	- Documents/processing-1.5.1
	- Documents/Arduino/Group02_BasicTargetingSoftware_ArduinoCode
	- Documents/Processing/Group02_BasicTargetingSoftware

2) Copy dll files to windows/system, windows/system32, windows/sysWOW64. 
	Processing will get angry if these dll files are missing

3) Open "Group02_BasicTargetingSoftware_ArduinoCode.ino" in the Arduino IDE, select the proper type in
	the "#define type" line, and upload it to your Arduino or Standalone controller.
	You only need to do this once ever, so close the Arduino IDE.

4) Finally, open "Group02_BasicTargetingSoftware.pde" in the Processing IDE. 
	Click run, and the code should start up for you.
